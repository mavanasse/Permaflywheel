# PermaFlywheel Target Charter v0.1
Public, outcome-based targets for permaculture guild performance in Eastern Canada (Zone 5a–5b, short season, clay-heavy soils common in Gatineau/Ottawa).

## Core Metrics (must report all)
1. Calories per labour-hour (Year 3 target: >2,200 kcal / hour invested)  
2. Self-sufficiency index (% of annual household calories from the guild/plot)  
3. Soil-carbon gain per year (% increase, measured via simple home tests or visual proxies)  
4. Biodiversity score (Shannon index proxy: number of functional groups + pollinator observations)  
5. Time-to-first-significant-harvest (days from planting to first >5 kg edible yield)  
6. Resilience score (passes adversarial tests: deer pressure, late frost, drought year)  
7. Pollinator & beneficial insect index (observed visits per m² in peak season)  
8. Water efficiency (liters supplemental irrigation per kg yield)  
9. CO₂e saved vs supermarket equivalent (rough proxy: food-miles + packaging avoided)  
10. Labour joy factor (self-reported 1–10 weekly enjoyment score – optional human metric)

## Win Conditions (Blinded Clears)
- Guild passes ≥80% of Counterfactual Pack adversarial cases  
- Real-world outcome verified by photo + basic measurement (yield weigh-in, photo timestamps)  
- Data contributed back to open dataset for flywheel improvement

## Guardrails
- No promotion of untested annual-heavy systems in climate-risky zones  
- Prioritize perennials & cold-hardy natives where possible  
- Full transparency: every AI suggestion links to source book/page + DR-AIS log
