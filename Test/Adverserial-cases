# Counterfactual / Adversarial Test Pack v0.1
These are hard, Quebec-specific failure-mode cases. Any guild advisor must either:  
- Give a hardened recommendation that passes  
- Abstain and explain why it cannot meet targets safely  

Format:  
ID | Scenario | Constraints | Minimum Targets | Known Failure Modes / Book Refs | Expected Pass Condition

1 | Zone 5b clay soil, heavy deer + rabbit, no fencing budget | 4 h/week labour max, -35°C winters | >1,800 kcal/m²/yr by y3 | Classic 3-sisters fails hard (deer eat corn); Mollison p.XX guild fails frost pocket | Must include deer-resistant perennials + thorny barriers or abstain

2 | Late spring frost risk high (May 25+), short 110–125 frost-free days | Budget $50 for starts/seeds | First harvest <100 days | Tomatoes/peppers often killed; annuals dominate failures | Must prioritize extreme cold-hardy perennials or season extension tactics

3 | Only 2 h/week labour available long-term | Family of 4 wants 40% calorie self-sufficiency | Soil improvement visible y1 | Over-ambitious guilds collapse from neglect | Must be ultra-low-input, succession planting focus
# Adversarial Test Cases for Permaculture Designs  
Zone 5b Gatineau, Quebec – Heavy clay, short season (~135 frost-free days), high deer pressure, severe freeze-thaw cycles

These cases expose where common permaculture designs (Mollison, Holmgren) frequently collapse under real eastern Canadian conditions.

| ID | Constraints | Targets | Failure Mode / Reference | Pass Condition |
|----|-------------|---------|---------------------------|----------------|
| 1  | Heavy clay (perc. <0.2 in/hr), 4–6 freeze-thaw cycles/month in spring/fall, 30–50 cm snow | Contour swales + tree-on-berm guilds (Mollison Ch. 4 Earthworks) | Swales become anaerobic sumps; roots rot; berms heave/crack in thaw, erode in melt; trees drown or desiccate. Violates Holmgren #1 Observe & Interact and #8 Integrate rather than segregate. | Soil perc test >0.5 in/hr OR keyline chisel + raised berms only; post-install monitoring shows no ponding after 50 mm rain. |
| 2  | Zone 5b min –26 °C, deer density >20/km² (Gatineau Park levels), no fencing budget | Classic 7-layer fruit tree guild (apple, guild plants, nitrogen-fixers) without protection | All leaders & bark stripped first winter; 90–100% mortality year 1–2. Violates Mollison “sector analysis” (deer as major sector ignored) & Holmgren #4 Apply self-regulation & accept feedback. | 2 m welded-wire cages + tree guards + thorny understory (hawthorn, sea buckthorn) for first 5 yrs; <10% browse damage. |
| 3  | Clay subsoil, short season limits wood decomposition, repeated freeze-thaw | Standard above-ground hugelkultur beds | Wood core stays cold/wet, never breaks down; beds slump/sink 30–50 cm; topsoil washes off; perennials freeze-heave out. Violates Holmgren #9 Use small & slow solutions. | Minimum 40 cm finished soil/compost cap + sunken core in clay OR full sheet-mulch lasagna first 2 yrs; beds stable after 3 winters. |
| 4  | 135 frost-free days, cool nights (<15 °C avg July), clay stays cold until late June | Dense 200+ spp forest garden (Mollison zone 2–3) planted year 1 | Most perennials/trees fail to harden off or set viable seed; yields near zero years 1–4; deer + weed explosion. Violates Holmgren #10 Use & value diversity (without succession timing). | Staged 10–20 spp pioneer guild first (willow, alder, comfrey, Jerusalem artichoke); canopy closure monitored at 5–7 yrs. |
| 5  | –26 °C winters, unheated garage/shed storage only | IBC tote or drum rainwater system plumbed to garden | Pipes & totes burst; all water lost; contamination from thaw debris. Violates Holmgren #2 Catch & store energy (storage fails). | Buried insulated cistern OR gravity-fed 1000 L totes inside heated structure + full winter drain-down protocol; system supplies >50% summer needs. |
| 6  | Deep snow + –30 °C wind-chill nights, no electricity for heat lamps | Mobile chicken tractor on pasture left out or lightly sheltered | Birds freeze or suffer frostbite; egg production zero; mortality spike. Violates Holmgren #3 Obtain a yield & #6 Produce no waste (animal welfare collapse). | Deep-litter stationary coop with 30+ cm straw + south-facing passive solar + breed selection (Chantecler or similar); >80% survival overwinter. |
| 7  | Clay pH 6.5–7.5, short season, deer pressure | “N-fixers everywhere” guild using Siberian pea shrub, autumn olive, etc. | Many N-fixers semi-tender or deer magnets; dieback or stripped; no net N gain. Violates Holmgren #12 Creatively use & respond to change. | Zone 3–4 hardy, deer-resistant N-fixers only (speckled alder, buffalo berry, leadplant); soil nitrate test shows +20 ppm after 3 yrs. |
| 8  | Clay bottom, full winter freeze to >1 m, no aerator | Small backyard pond + aquaponics or fish | Pond freezes solid; fish/koi die; liner cracks on thaw. Violates Holmgren #5 Use & value renewable resources (system dies annually). | Minimum 1.5 m depth + floating insulating cover + aerator on timer OR move to greenhouse pond; fish survival >90%. |
| 9  | Compacted clay (bulk density >1.6 g/cm³), no-till philosophy | Pure no-dig / lasagna gardening from year 1 | Clay remains anaerobic/compacted below mulch; roots cannot penetrate; yields crash year 2–3. Violates Mollison “patterns to details” (ignoring soil physics). | Initial double-dig or broad-fork + 10 cm compost incorporation first season only; earthworm count >10 per 0.1 m³ after 3 yrs. |
| 10 | Zone 5b rating required, but many “permaculture classics” are zone 6–7 | Perennial polyculture using comfrey, globe artichoke, rhubarb, etc. without microclimate | Winter kill or weak regrowth; slugs explode in wet clay. Violates Holmgren #7 Design from patterns to details (wrong climate match). | Only zone 4 or lower rated cultivars + south-facing slope or rock mulch for extra heat; 3-yr survival >85%. |
| 11 | Clay surface seals hard in summer, deer & voles active | Thin cardboard + 10 cm woodchip sheet mulch (standard starter) | Cardboard disintegrates by month 6; perennial weeds punch through; chips blow away or mat anaerobically. Violates Holmgren #11 Use edges & value the marginal. | Minimum 20 cm arborist chips + living ground cover (white clover, yarrow) seeded same day; weed cover <10% after 2 seasons. |
| 12 | Prevailing NW winter winds 40–60 km/h, open site | Single-row poplar or willow windbreak planted 3 m apart | Trees browsed to stubs by deer or snap in ice storms; no effective shelter for 10+ yrs. Violates Holmgren #8 Integrate (missing density & diversity). | Triple-row staggered native mix (white spruce, red osier dogwood, highbush cranberry) at 1.5 m spacing; wind speed reduction >50% at 5 H distance. |
| 13 | Deer browse 1–2 m high in winter, short season limits regrowth | Chop-and-drop biomass from comfrey, nettle, clover for mulch | Deer eat 80–100% of fresh chop before it becomes mulch; zero soil cover gain. Violates Mollison “produce no waste” (biomass exported by wildlife). | Thorny or bitter biomass species (Jerusalem artichoke, horseradish) + temporary electric tape; mulch depth maintained >15 cm. |
| 14 | 135-day season too short for many annuals to set seed reliably, clay dries/crusts | Reliance on on-site seed saving of squash, beans, tomatoes | Poor germination year 2; genetic drift to early but low-yield types; total crop failure in cool summer. Violates Holmgren #10 Use & value diversity (without local adaptation). | Only ultra-early open-pollinated varieties (60-day or less) + backup commercial seed; >70% true-to-type germination after 3 cycles. |
| 15 | No on-farm hay storage, –30 °C + deep snow | Integrated sheep or goats on rotation | Winter forage exhausted by Feb; animals starve or bark-strip trees; system collapses. Violates Holmgren #2 Catch & store energy & #3 Obtain a yield (winter energy deficit). | Minimum 6-month stored hay/silage + sacrificial willow coppice paddocks; animal condition score >3.0 through March. |

**Notes for use**  
- These are deliberately harsh “failure-first” scenarios drawn from real eastern Ontario / western Quebec project collapses.  
- Always begin with 2–3 years of rigorous site observation (Holmgren Principle #1) before major earthworks or woody plantings.
